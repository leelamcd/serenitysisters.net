				<h2>Meet the Dog-Lovin' Sistas</h2>
				
				<p>	<b>Leela has been taking care of children and animals for almost 10 years now. As a graduate of UC Berkeley, she’s dealt with a variety of issues and opportunities that have tested her efficiency, sensibility, and patience. She has learned to combine her logic and intuition to respond quickly to any challenges that arise, whether on or off the job. Her degree in atmospheric science is a testament to her consonance with environmental responsibility and, ultimately, human justice. She plans to lend herself to volunteer work overseas as a positive outlet for her energy and intention.

<br><br>Alana has experience caring for both cats and dogs through her work at the North Central Animal Shelter. She is keen and agile when it comes to interacting with pets; her connection with animals is heightened by her own energy and vibrance, which she naturally brings to every social and professional setting. Currently she is pursuing her interest in anthropology and cognitive science through her education at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

 

<br><br>We are mindful, loving, and alert, and continue to cultivate these qualities through our daily practice of meditation and yoga. We hope that our presence in your home and/or with your pets will dispel any concerns you have about being away. We understand that finding a sitter you can trust is not always easy, which is why we’re so delighted to offer you an honest and affordable solution!  </b>
